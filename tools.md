This page presents the tools that were developed during the research. I try to provide as much information as possible and to open source the projects on GitHub as time allows. If you have problems with the tools, please contact me.

<h2>BuildDiff</h2>
<!--<div>Download | GitHub</div> -->
<div style="text-align: justify;">BuildDiff is a differencing tool that extracts the changes that were performed between two Maven configuration files (pom.xml) and provides a taxonomy of build changes. It can be used to analyze build configuration of projects that use Maven as build tool. 
If you use BuildDiff, please cite the corresponding paper mentioned below.
